You can customize the behavior of displaying notifications (which appear, for example, in the event of a validation error).  

For this, there are 2 parameters in the **config/dashboard.php** configuration file

**notification_auto_close_enable** - accepts a boolean value, which means to enable or disable auto-hide   
**notification_auto_close_after** -  takes a numeric value and sets the number of seconds after which the notification will be closed
